the smaller arrays (tiny & small) seem to do better with unshift. 
extra large and large seem to have the most significant difference and so 
i think they scale better. i remember that unshift has to shift a bunch of numbers
and then add the new one at the beginning so i can understand that the difference 
between doing this with a million and 10 numbers is very different.
